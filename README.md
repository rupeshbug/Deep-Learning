This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects, showcasing various machine learning techniques and models for tasks such as prediction, recommendation, and classification.

1. House Price Prediction
A project that predicts house prices using the kc_house_data dataset. It applies both a Random Forest model and a Neural Network to analyze and predict prices based on various features.

2. Product Recommendation Analysis
This project uses customer comments and reviews to predict whether a product will be recommended or not. It employs RNN and LSTM models to analyze textual data from the WomensClothingReviews.csv dataset, aiming to improve personalized product recommendations.

4. Image Classification
A deep learning project focused on classifying images as "happy" or "sad." It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other techniques for effective emotion recognition from images.
